## 🧠 INTRODUCTION

*When firewalls sleep, Wuzen hunts.*  
Some tools *scan for weaknesses*. Wuzen creates them.  
It doesn’t knock — it’s already inside, wearing your admin badge, sipping coffee, and taking notes. 😈  

Wuzen is an elite-grade, stealth-control platform engineered for those who demand *total dominance* over target systems. With a control panel so sharp it could cut glass, Wuzen doesn’t just *monitor* — it owns.
